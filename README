      ALERT's KESI - Knowledge Extractor for Structured Information 
==========================================================================

The Knowledge Extractor for Structured Information (or KESI) is a component
of the ALERT platform [1] design to to gather information from source code 
repositories and from issue/bug tracking systems. Once the information has
been gathered, is transformed into a format known by the rest of the
components of the platform and published in a message queue.

The information obtained by the KESI is critical in the following scenarios:
 - Recommend a developer which bug to solve.
 - Detect duplicated bugs.
 - Let the developer know about buggy parts of the code.
 - Identifying inactive developers and orphaned parts of the code
 
This program is free software under the terms of the GNU General Public
License, version 2 or any later version.

== Features ==
 - Supports several types of repositories
   - Source Code Management Systems (SCM): Git, Subversion
   - Issue tracking systems (ITS): Bugzilla, Jira
 - Uses external tools for gathering information
   - Source Code Management Systems (SCM): CVSAnalY
   - Issue tracking systems (ITS): Bicho
 - Incremental analysis
 - Publishes the changes in repositories as events via MQ

== Requirements ==
 - Any implementation of Java Platform, Standard Edition (>= 1.6)
 - JDBC driver for MySQL [2]
 - JavaMail API (>= 1.4.4) [3]
 - Apache Geronimo JMS (>= 1.1.1) [4]
 - Apache ActiveMQ Core (>= 5.5.1) [5]
 - CVSAnalY (>= 2.1.2-M24-alert) [6]
 - Bicho (>= 0.13-alert) [7]
 
== Getting the code ==

 - ZIP package
     http://github.com/AlertProject/KESI/archive/master.zip

 - Git repository
     git://github.com/AlertProject/KESI.git
     
== Building KESI ==

To build KESI you will need any implementation of the Java Development
Kit (>= 1.6) and Maven (>= 2) [8]. Once you have installed these software
tools, run the next command from the KESI root folder.

 $ mvn package [-Ddir=<path>]
 
This command will build the program and will create several packages
in <path>. If <path> is not set, the packages will be stored by default
in the directory "target" of your KESI root directory.

== Configuration ==

KESI uses the Java Preferences files to store its configuration
parameters. Examples of these can be found in "src/config" directory.

In addition, you will need to create two databases for storing the
data retrieved from issue tracking systems and source code repositories.

== Running KESI ==

To run KESI you will need the file "KESI-{version}-all.jar" created
during the building phase. Type the next command and KESI will run.

 $ java -jar KESI-{version}-all.jar [<config>] 

Where <config> is the file with the configuration parameters.
For your first execution, you will need a config file. See "src/config"
directory for examples.

ATTENTION: Please take into account that running KESI with a
configuration file will delete other configuration parameters set
from previous executions.
